## Overview

HRWise is a fine-tuned, enterprise-ready AI assistant that helps employees of a fictitious international bank navigate HR policies, benefits, and internal processes with consistent, compliant, and context-aware responses. Unlike generic assistants that provide vague or misaligned answers, HRWise is trained on synthetic internal HR documentation to mirror the organization’s language and standards, ensuring reliable guidance every time.

Built with Azure AI Foundry, HRWise leverages fine-tuning of GPT models, prompt engineering, and content filters to promote responsible AI use and prevent potential harm. This project showcases how enterprises can create domain-specific assistants that combine accuracy, compliance, and conversational intelligence for real-world HR scenarios.

## Situation

I was inspired by how companies like Workday and Oracle use AI to streamline HR operations, but I wanted something more precise and aligned with an organization’s internal voice. I envisioned a solution where an AI assistant could understand HR policies, procedures, and employee queries in the exact language of the company—consistent, compliant, and context-aware. 

By fine-tuning GPT models with synthetic internal HR documentation from a fictitious international bank and layering in content filters, the goal was to create a responsible AI system that provides accurate guidance while safeguarding against harmful or inappropriate outputs. Instead of being a generic HR bot, it acts like a trusted, well-informed HR representative available 24/7.

## Task 

Fine-tune the language model with the Azure AI Foundry to provide consistency in the desired behavior and add content filters to promote responsible use of AI and prevent any potential harm. 

## Action

1. Create a Synthetic Dataset containing the HR 


## Result

## Technologies Used

1. Azure AI Foundry – Model deployment & orchestration
2. Azure OpenAI Service – gpt-4o model for response generation
4. Ada-002 Embedding Model – Document embeddings
5. Python SDKs – Integration and client application
